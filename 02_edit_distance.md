# 02 - Edit distance

## Defining minimum edit distance

Edit distance
        Is the minimum number of editing (Insertion, Deletion, Substitution) operations needed to transform one into the other.

Cost of each operation: 1

Levenshtein:
        Substitutions cost 2

Minimum Edit Distance

        Is String X of length n
        Is String Y of length m
        Then the minimum edit distance is D(n, m)
